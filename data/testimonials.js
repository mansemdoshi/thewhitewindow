From the start, she created a safe, non-judgmental space where I could open up at my own pace. Her trauma-informed approach and deep patience have been instrumental in my healing. She consistently goes above and beyond, always keeping my needs at the center of our sessions. The flexibility of online sessions has also made it easier to stay consistent.
